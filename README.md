# Tesla Sensor Data Dashboard üöó

A real-time sensor monitoring dashboard inspired by Tesla's technology for autonomous vehicles and manufacturing systems. This project simulates sensor data for **temperature**, **pressure**, and **vibration** and integrates machine learning for predictive maintenance, offering insights into potential failures similar to systems used in Tesla vehicles.

## üìä Project Overview

This dashboard provides a responsive and interactive visualization of real-time sensor data, designed to aid in proactive maintenance and diagnostic analysis, essential in autonomous and high-performance vehicle systems. Using WebSockets for real-time updates, MongoDB for data storage, and a predictive machine learning model, this project aims to emulate Tesla‚Äôs approach to vehicle health monitoring.
